**Prediction of directional movement in Financial Markets - An Optimization Approach**

The forecasting of stock price may serve as an essential recommendation system to invest money in stock market. Every investor mainly looks for maximum profit that can be earned and it is quite difficult to select appropriate stock prediction system for the investments. It is necessary to choose a forecasting algorithm for making accurate prediction and this completely depends on a particular algorithm because every algorithm performs in a different way and give different results. Algorithms such as SVR, Linear regression are available but this might not give accurate results in time series data. While the algorithm such as SARIMA, SARIMAX, VAR, VARMA, VARMAX, ARIMA etc. are available for time series data. Some neural networks such as RNN and LSTM can also be used for time series data and neural networks are meant to be learn appropriately. The focus of this study will be on LSTM and ARIMA the results generated by both of these techniques are analysed and explained how these two techniques are performing.

**LSTM Approach**

Long short-term memory (LSTM) is a part of recurrent neural network. LSTM based model can predict some arbitrary values into the future after getting trained on the basis of previous information or historical data. A traditional LSTMconsists cell state (ct), hidden state (ht), input gate, forgetgate and output gate which makes LSTM efficient in terms ofboth long-term and short-term dependencies.

Below are the key terms from our LSTM model.
a) Optimizer used: Adam.
b) Dropout per iteration: 20%
c) Loss function used: Mean squared error (MSE).
d) Batch size used: 64
e) Epochs: Trained for 100 epochs.
f) Validation size: 35% of total data.
g) Validation loss: 0.0011
